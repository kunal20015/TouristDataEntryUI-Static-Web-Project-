# TouristDataEntryUI-Static-Web-Project-
This project is a tourist enquiry web form built using HTML and CSS with Java Servlets for backend handling. It collects structured user details through a styled interface and sends the data to a servlet, where it is processed and logged to the server console, demonstrating basic client-server communication and form handling.
